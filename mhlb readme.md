# Mammogram machine learning exploration

*Description*: An exploration into the UC Irvine mammography dataset, conducted as an assessment for the Machine Learning in Biomedicine and Healthcare module at UCL. 

*Aim*: Use simple machine learning models to predict the malignancy of tumours found in mammography scans. The input features are descriptions of the scans made by a clinician.
